# RegressionAanalysis
 Wine is an alcoholic beverage that has been a most favoured drink for numerous
occasions for centuries. Wine is made from fermented grapes. The yeast in grapes
consumes its sugar and breaks down into two compounds i.e ethanol ans carbon
dioxide. Wine has been further divided into two categories i.e red wine and white
wine which is formed from the red and white grapes respectively.There has been many
restrictions within different countries that impose a quality check on wine to make
sure it is good for consumption.Hence it is important to detect the quality of wine
that is being used for customer satisfaction. The quality of wine depends on variety of
factors that need to be taken into account. In this paper we will address the factors
on which the quality of wine depends on. We will also check if we can easily predict
the quality of wine given the variables of the data. Regression analysis will be used
for our experiments ,interpretations and results. Some of the the questions we will
address in this paper will be whether the , if there is any correlation between the
variables, if the variables in data are significant for our wine quality , what are the
top chemical properties chemical properties that differentiate high and low quality
wine and if we are correctly able to predict the wine quality through are final model.
